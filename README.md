## Instructions

Your challenge is to build out this Quote Generator App and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This project focuses mostly on CSS and Flexbox in general. There's a tiny bit of JS included for making API call using Fetch API and Manipulating DOM Content.

You can use any tools (Tailwind CSS , Vite , etc..) you like to help you complete this project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your project should:

- Be responsive for desktop and mobile phones
- Have minimum functionalities and effects working

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in image formats.

If you want to design the app in your own way feel free to do so. Just make sure that functionality remains same and try to make it responsive.
